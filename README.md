# Portfolio of SalomeK Mphago

## About The Project

This week we were tasked with creating a web application from scratch. I built a one page portfolio using the html and css skills I have learned so far.

The Portfolio clearly states my name, it has a picture of what I look like for a Potential Employer and just incase the person viewing my Portfolio wants to know what I look like.

## What Is In The Project

My-Portfolio consists of Five Pages. The main(body) background image is a wallpaper I created with all the ways you can greet a person in South Africa.
I used a grid to structure all my content.

### Home Page

### Resume Page
The resume page will be updated as I progress with this class, so here I just added some fun 'updated version coming soon' text and added a hover effect.
