This week we were tasked with creating a web application from scratch. I built a one page portfolio using the html and css skills I have learned so far.

The Portfolio clearly states my name, it has a picture of what I look like for a 'potential employer'.

The header section has the important headings with a hover effect.
The about me section contains a paragraph about my work experience, where I live and where I am from.
The work section has five pictures of work I have done in the past.
The resume section will be updated as I progress with this class, so here I just added some fun 'updated version coming soon' text and added a hover effect.
The footer/contact me section has links that, when clicked on will redirect you to the said pages and you will be able to see all the other work that I have done.
